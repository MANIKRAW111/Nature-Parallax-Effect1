        <h2>Nature</h2>
        <p>Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to the planetâ€™s beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find their habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is essential to take proper care of our nature to maintain a healthy life.</p>

        <h2>Grow More Trees</h2>
        <p>Trees are our best friends on the Earth.  We just cannot continue to live on Earth if there are no trees around us.  All we do for the trees is that we give some little space and water.  They return that favour by giving us life and much more every day. We need to grow more trees to make our surroundings better and to compensate for the deforestation and reducing effects of air pollution.   To better our individual and social health let us grow more trees.     Planting trees is not very expensive.  However, plants need water regularly for some months. We get fresh air and oxygen from them.  So we live healthily. We get shade under the trees during the summer.  We enjoy the sight of beautiful trees and plants, so colorful with beautiful flowers, useful vegetables and fruits.  The roots of trees go deep inside the Earth and hold the terrain from getting eroded due to water or wind.The trees also cool the wind and the atmosphere.</p>
